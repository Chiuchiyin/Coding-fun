The data is scraped from https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/ , scraped by cities for convenience. 
"body_(cities).csv" are scrapped from html body while "header_(cities).csv" are from the header.
Only "body_(cities).csv" are planned to be used for this project, it has more complete information. "header_(cities).csv" could serve as back up.
"header_(cities).csv" has image links saved which could be repurposed for other project, assuming host is not going to delete them anytime soon.
